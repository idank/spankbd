# Span keyboard

Span is a low profile split keyboard with 3x5 column staggered keys with 2u, 1.5u, 1u thumb clusters.

The keyboard layout is derived from GergoPlex, a keyboard that was originally available on gboards.ca
(now defunct).

Features:

* 18x17 mm choc spacing.
* Optional 2u choc stabilizer.
* OLED support.
* Hybrid hotswap / direct soldering for switches.

## Availability

Kits and built keyboards can be purchased on *[holykeebs](https://holykeebs.com)*.

Gerber files are available in the releases page. Note that currently the keyboard is not reversible (there are files for
left / right sides). This makes it easier to deal with as a store, although it is not ideal if making just one keyboard.
A reversible version may be added in the future.

## Guide

Will be added in the near future.
