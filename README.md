# Span keyboard

![span](https://i.imgur.com/kR0Uapph.png)

Span is a low profile split keyboard with 3x5 column staggered keys with 2u, 1.5u, 1u thumb clusters.

The keyboard layout is derived from GergoPlex, a keyboard that was originally available on gboards.ca
(now defunct).

Features:

* 18x17 mm choc spacing.
* Optional 2u choc stabilizer.
* OLED support.
* Hybrid hotswap / direct soldering for switches.

The pcbs aren't reversible at the moment: I prefer the cleaner look of the top
side and generally think it's easier to deal with. A reversible version may be
added in the future.

## Availability

Kits and built keyboards can be purchased on *[holykeebs](https://holykeebs.com)*.
